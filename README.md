# Mental Illnesses vs Obesity Project

## Overview
A data analytics project attempting to correlate commonalities between people with mental illnesses such as panic or anxiety attacks and obesity. The project contains three csv files, which were pulled from Kaggle.com. The links and datasets can be found in the Data section of the README. 

### Questions to answer:
1. Does gender influence the likelihood of having obesity or anxiety/panic attacks? Does it differ between genders?
2. What age groups have the highest rates?
3. Are smokers more likely to be obese or have mental illnesses?

### Data:
The dataset used in this project contains information about mental and physical conditions including anxiety, panic attacks, and obesity.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
* Data exploration: Jupyter notebook to explore the dataset
* Analysis: Using Python with Pandas and Numpy packages to clean the data
* Visualizations: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize my findings

## Getting Started:
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Julia-Heffner/Capstone_Mental_Illness.git`
2. Create a virtual environment with which to run the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open and run .ipynb file. 

### Virtual Environment Instructions
1. After you have cloned the repo to your machine, navigate to the project 
folder in GitBash/Terminal.
1. Create a virtual environment in the project folder. 
1. Activate the virtual environment.
1. Install the required packages. 
1. When you are done working on your repo, deactivate the virtual environment.

Virtual Environment Commands

| Command | Linux/Mac | GitBash |
